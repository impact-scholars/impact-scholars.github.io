# First of all, why?

ISP micropublications are written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/guide), a markup language designed for scientific writing. In short:

- It's **easy to learn**: just markdown will get you most of the way there. MyST just adds some useful features.
- The MyST ecosystem allows us to create both a **PDF** and a rich, interactive, shareable **website** from the same source.

# Roadmap

In this tutorial, we will:

1. [Create](#template) a repository starting from a GitHub Template
1. [Clone](#clone) it on our machine
1. [Install](#python) a Python distribution
1. [Install MyST](#myst-install)
1. [Preview](#previewing) changes locally
1. [Edit](#editing) your article, and
1. [See your deployed site live!](#deploy)

Jump to sections that are relevant to you, and feel free to skip any if you're confident.

# Steps

To follow this, you'll need:
- A GitHub account: https://github.com/login
- `git` and `gh` installed: [`git` instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [`gh` instructions](https://cli.github.com/)

Very basic git familiarity is required. For a simple overview, you can read the [GitHub intro](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git). We'll only need `clone`, `add`, `commit` and `push`.

(template)=
## Using a GitHub Template

Github templates are like repository recipes. To write your scientific article, we'll use one we prepared; it already contains all the configuration you need, and features a simple sample document for you to have a quick syntax reference. For a more detailed reference, see the [MyST guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/commonmark).

Navigate to https://github.com/impact-scholars/isp-micropublication-template and log in. You'll use the button in the top right labeled "Use this template" to create a new repository in your github account:

```{figure} ./img/template_top.png
```

```{note}
For your repository, use a working name for now. You should set the visibility as public[^public]. When you're ready to submit it, we'll use this format: `firstauthor-year-three-word-title`. 
```

Once the repository is created, you'll be taken to the URL of your repository. It will look like this: `https://github.com/`, followed by your username, and then your repository name. For this tutorial, let's use `https://github.com/octocat/smith-2022-how-to-ISP`

(clone)=
## Cloning the repo

If you have never used `git` before, we'll need to authenticate you[^auth]. On Windows, use the terminal "Git bash" for terminal commands (it comes with `git`); for Linux and MacOS, use any terminal you like. The easiest way to set up authentication is to run `gh auth login`. Using ssh keys is more secure, but you will need to remember the password you set. You'll be asked to open a link in the browser, and you'll be authenticated. If you'd rather use a graphical UI, GitHub provides [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

Once your `git` setup is complete, we're ready to clone your repository. To do so, move to the directory you want to use, and use the `gh repo clone` command: `gh repo clone octocat/smith-2022-how-to-ISP`[^why-gh].


(python)=
## Installing a python distribution

Select the right version for your OS from [conda-forge.org/download](https://conda-forge.org/download/) and install it. For more detailed instructions, follow the [Conda tutorial](conda-tutorial.md).


(myst-install)=
## Installing MyST

Now, we'll use the package manager we installed to get your environment ready to author. Move into the folder where you cloned your repository. The file `environment.yml` contains a "recipe" for the package manager to create an environment with all the dependencies (i.e. programs) you need. Read it: it's short. Here's how to create and activate the environment:

```bash
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   mamba activate isp-paper
```

Next time you work on your paper, just activate the environment (`mamba activate isp-paper`) and you'll be ready to go!

(previewing)=
## Previewing changes locally

First, let's check everything's working. From the repository directory, run `myst start`. After a small loading, you'll get an update that looks like:
```txt
🔌 Server started on port 3000!  🥳 🎉


        👉  http://localhost:3000  👈
```
Depending on your terminal, you may be able to click on the link or might have to open it on your browser. That's it! This will be your local testing environment. If you change something in your article, you'll see the website update. You will also find the PDF version of your paper in the top right corner, under the download icon.

(editing)=
## Editing your article

To edit your article, use any text editor you like. We suggest `vscode`: it's well supported across platform, mostly open[^vscode] and simple. The files you'll have to edit are `myst.yml`, which contains metadata information about authors and content, `index.md`, which contains your paper. If you're looking for a more complete authoring guide, read the official [mystmd guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/typography).


(deploy)=
## Deploying

To deploy your preview paper on the web, you will use GitHub pages. It's a free service provided by GitHub to public repositories. To enable GitHub pages on your repository, navigate to your repo on GitHub, click on `Settings`->`Pages` and under "Source" select GitHub Actions[^auto].
Once you enable GitHub pages, on every push your website will be built and deployed.




[^public]: GitHub, in its free tier, only allows public repos to use the GitHub pages service, which we'll use for your deployment.
[^auth]: by "authenticate", we mean enable the `git` running in your computer to access the website `github.com`, and act as your profile.
[^why-gh]: using `gh` allows us to avoid explaining credentials in detail. 
[^vscode]: yes, parts are not FOSS. the extension that provides `myst` is not currently published on Open VSX Registry.
[^auto]: since your `gh` is already authenticated with GitHub you can run (substitute `{owner}` and `{repo}` with your username and the name of your repository): 

    ```bash
    gh api \
      --method POST \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
      /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages \
      -f build_type="workflow"
    ```
